I recently came across the term lithromantic, and I think it describes me fairly well. I am romantically attracted to people, but I rarely feel the need to be in a relationship with them. There have been times were I'd tell someone that I have crush on them, but when they'd ask me if I wanted to date them I would say no, leaving them very confused. It's not that I minded them liking me back. It's just that I'm not super comfortable being in a romantic relationships with someone. So what do you think? Does it sound like I'm lithromantic?
